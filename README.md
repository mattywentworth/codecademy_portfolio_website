# Portfolio Website



## Purpose

This project was a component of Codecademy's full-stack career path and a way to practice some of what I've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also provides a place to show what I'm learning about software engineering.

There were a few main requirements of the project:
1. Create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. The site must be multiple pages
3. Make it responsive
4. Use version control


## Approach

I started out by making a rough wireframe of the homepage in Google Draw. Then I created and styled the header and footer, and I was able to create the main section of each page fairly quickly after that.


## Challenges

Even though I'm not a great designer, I'm pretty critical of design. So it was tough to accept that the look and feel of the site wouldn't be amazing. Once I forced myself to just choose colors, fonts, etc and get on with it, it was easier to accept that it wouldn't be a visual materpiece.

This was the first time I used border box. The use of border box itself wasn't a challenge, but I ran into a few sizing issues that took me a while to figure out and associate with the box-sizing value I was using.

This was also the first time I used JavaScript and HTML together for a website I built from scratch. It wasn't particularly difficult, but I had some extended troubleshooting in order to get the code to function properly together.

I still haven't used Git much, so I had to refer to documentation for a lot of the operations to commit files, create new branches, navigate branches, and delete commits to the wrong branch.
