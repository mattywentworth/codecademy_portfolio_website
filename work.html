                        <p class="work-description">After learning HTML and CSS, I wanted to practice what I had learned by replicating an existing site's homepage. So I decided to recreate the homepage for Stensul, which is the last company I worked at as a salesperson. My goal was to produce something close to a clone of the homepage without using Chrome dev tools to give me any clues about the HTML and CSS structure.</p>

                        <p class="work-description">This was a project created as a part of the Codecademy full-stack career path coursework. The purpose was to use JavaScript to practice functions, loops, and iterators. The output needed to be a randomly-generated message of some kind, and I chose to make it in the structure, tone, and style of something Donald Trump might say.</p>
